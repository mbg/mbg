I am a Software Engineer at [Tweag](https://tweag.io), consulting for [Hachi Security](https://github.com/HachiSecurity). I like open-source, teaching, and all things to do with programming languages!

I maintain a number of Haskell libraries, which you can find on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/user/mbg). Some that you might be interested in are:

- [`wai-rate-limit`](https://github.com/mbg/wai-rate-limit), which allows you to add rate limiting to your web applications; also available specifically for Servant.
- [`wai-saml2`](https://github.com/mbg/wai-saml2) if you are building a SAML2 Service Provider.
- [`logstash`](https://github.com/mbg/logstash) implements various logger backends that can write to Logstash.
- [`network-wait`](https://github.com/mbg/network-wait) lets you wait for networked services to become available.
- [`moss`](https://github.com/mbg/moss), a client for [Moss](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/), which is a code similarity checking tool.
- [`c14n`](https://github.com/mbg/c14n) provides Haskell bindings for the C14N implementation (XML normalisation) in `libxml2`.
- [`time-units-types`](https://github.com/mbg/time-units-types), a small library for representing time units at the type-level.
- [`hindley-milner`](https://github.com/mbg/hindley-milner) is a template for when you are building a Hindley Milner derived language and want a starting point.
- [`hoop`](https://github.com/mbg/hoop) is an experimental library I built while studying for a PhD, which implements an object system in Haskell.

For all of my functional programming teaching materials, head over to the [fpclass](https://github.com/fpclass) organisation.
